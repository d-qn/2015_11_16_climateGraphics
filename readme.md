### Data


####### Greenhouse gas emission intensities per capita, 2012

### Ideas

2. Greenhouse gas emission intensities: show absolute values, % difference since 1990 by capita and by GDP
1. Show the cumulative CO2 emission by country/regions, similarly as: [cumulative co2 emission 1850-2010](http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/cumulative-emissions-data.png)
	* or the share ![image](Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 16.57.43.png)
    * Maybe show emission per country per capita 1850-2010  
3. Breakdown carbon emission by sector by country
4. Share of renewable energy by country (OECD)

3. CO2 transfer by country & regions

##### 5 graphics to make sense of the COP21 climate talks and of its challenges

Jusqu'au 11 décembre 2015, des milliers de diplomates et politiciens du monde entier se réunissent à Paris pour le "COP21" (21ème Conférence des Nations Unies sur les changements climatiques). C’est une échéance importante, puisqu’elle doit aboutir à un nouvel accord international sur le climat. L’objectif est de maintenir le réchauffement mondial en deçà de deux degrés. Contrairement au protocole de Kyoto en 2005 ratifié principalement par les pays développés, ce nouvel accord devrait être applicable par tous les 196 pays participants quel que soit leur niveau de développement et leur richesse. 

Some difficult questions will be raised during COP21. How much should global emissions be cut? What actions should each country take? How much financial aid should wealthier nations offer to poorer nations to adapt to global warming?

Here is a series of graphics with the latest climate data that help making sense of the climate talks and understanding the challenges to find an agreement.

*CO2 emissions, the blame game*

Whenever global warming is discussed, greenhouse gas emissions is not far...  Voici les émissions de gaz à effet de serres (CO2, méthane, ...) par pays:

**Current greenhouse gas emissions intensities (absolute, % change since 1990, by capita and by GDP-PPP)**

Looking at the total emissions by country above, the greenhouse gas emitted by China or the United States might look staggering. While Switzerland emissions might appear insignificant compared to other countries. Naturally, large countries tend to be more populated and hence emit more carbon. A more useful measure compare to countries and account for different population size is to use the emissions per capita (person). With this measure, China greenhouse gas emissions per person is less than 30% more than Switzerland (8.1 vs 6.3 tonnes CO2 per capita).  

The emissions by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) gives an idea of how much carbon a country emit for a million USD of economic outuput. With this metric, Switzerland is the most carbon efficient given its economic output. 


`Greenhouse gas
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. There are many  different greenhouse gases, such as: methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N20) and carbon dioxyde (CO2). CO2 is by far the most common greenhouse gas, it accounts for more than 75% of the worlwide greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. 
How big is a ton of CO2?
A ton of CO2 would fill a small house with a footprint of 116 sq meters and an average height of 4 meters.`



Currently, developing countries emit the most greenhouse gas. In 2013, 58% of all CO2 emissions come from developing countries. That is why wealthy countries insist that China and developping economies to curb their emissions.

These data above gives a current snapshot view of the yearly greenhouse emissions. But if one wish to to assess the contribution of each country to global warming, it is necessary to look at the historical carbon emissions. It is the sum of all the CO2 emissions since the industrial age, which contributes to global warming. The graphic under shows the total carbon emissions since 1850:

**Historical emissions from fossil fuel 1870-2013**

Developed nations such as the United States and European countries are responsible for about half of all carbon emissions from fossil fuels that have ben emitted since 1850. They have long enjoyed the economical growth  from using fossil fuels — and now other countries understandably wish economical growth before considering to curb their carbon emission. 

The chart above explains why some people put the blame for current global warming on developed nations and are asking for financial aid to adapt.

Developed countries like Switzerland by contrast, like to point that the carbon emission by capita or GDP is rapidly increasing in developing countries.  

If most developed countries such as Switzerland have successfully curbed their carbon emissions over the last decades, they also have long ago shifted their economy to the service sector, hereby relying economically less on typically more polluting sector such as manufacturing. (first grahic by GDP)

**Transfer CO2 emissions**

Although European nations can rejoice of having decreased their carbon emissions over the last decades. The Global Carbon Budget 2014 report notes that virtually all of the reductions in emissions made by wealthy countries like the US and Europe since 1990 have been offset by "outsourced" emissions to places like China. 

Should the carbon emissions used to produce consumer good items (such as smartphone, clothes, ...) be accounted by the producing country or the final destinanation country who bought these items? This is a complicated issue, but it is possible to account for emissions embodied in goods and services that are produced in one country but consumed in others. The graphic under shows the "consumption carbon emissions" instead of the territorial or production emissions per capita. 










**What is the big deal of COP21?**

COP21 is seen as something of a “last hope”, and a vital step to getting global agreement on emissions reductions. The aim is to keep global warming below 2° C. This agreement to applicable from 2020 on is meant to follow on the Kyoto protocol which came into effect in 2005. While the Kyoto protocol was only ratified by developped countries, the challenge of the COP21 is to bring together the 195 participating states around an agreement. 


COP21 brings together leaders from around the world with the aim of achieving a legally binding and universal agreement on the climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2°C. This will happen through discussion on emissions reductions and other measures required to avert the looming global catastrophe of climate change.
