### Data


####### Greenhouse gas emission intensities per capita, 2012

### Ideas

2. Greenhouse gas emission intensities: show absolute values, % difference since 1990 by capita and by GDP
1. Show the cumulative CO2 emission by country/regions, similarly as: [cumulative co2 emission 1850-2010](http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/cumulative-emissions-data.png)
	* or the share ![image](Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 16.57.43.png)
    * Maybe show emission per country per capita 1850-2010  
3. Breakdown carbon emission by sector by country
4. Share of renewable energy by country (OECD)

3. CO2 transfer by country & regions

##### 3 graphics to make sense of the COP21 climate talks and of its challenges

Jusqu'au 11 décembre 2015, des milliers de diplomates et politiciens du monde entier se réunissent à Paris pour le "COP21" (21ème Conférence des Nations Unies sur les changements climatiques). C’est une échéance importante, puisqu’elle doit aboutir à un nouvel accord international sur le climat. L’objectif est de maintenir le réchauffement mondial en deçà de deux degrés. Contrairement au protocole de Kyoto en 2005 ratifié principalement par les pays développés, ce nouvel accord devrait être applicable par tous les 196 pays participants quel que soit leur niveau de développement et leur richesse. 

Some difficult questions will be raised during COP21. How much should global emissions be cut? What actions should each country take? How much financial aid should wealthier nations offer to poorer nations to adapt to global warming?

Here is a series of graphics with the latest climate data that help making sense of the climate talks and explaining the challenges to find an agreement.

*CO2 emissions, the blame game*

Whenever global warming is discussed, greenhouse gas emissions is not far. Voici les émissions de gaz à effet de serres (CO2, méthane, ...) par pays:


**Current greenhouse gas emissions intensities (absolute, % change since 1990, by capita and by GDP-PPP)**

Currently, developing countries emit the most greenhouse gas. Whether it is in absolute terms or relative. 

However when considering global warming and greenhouse gas, looking at the total of C02 emissions since the industrial age (1850), the US and Europe are responsible for much of the CO2 already in the atmosphere...

**Cumulative emissions from fossil fuel 1870-2013**

Developed nations such as Switzerland, the United States and European countries are responsible for about half of all carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement that have been emitted since 1870. They ave long enjoyed the economical growth benefits from using fossil fuels — and now other countries understandably wish economical growth before considering to curb their carbon emission. 


This chart explains why some people put the blame for current global warming on developed nations and are asking for financial aid to adapt. Developed countries like Switzerland by contrast, like to point that the carbon emission by capita or GDP is rapidly increasing and is now higher in developing countries. 

If most developed countries such as Switzerland have successfully curbed their carbon emissions over the last decades, they also have long ago shifted their economy to the service sector, hereby relying economically less on typically more polluting sector such as manufacturing.


**Transfer CO2 emissions**


What causes global warming? Greenhouse gases (CO2 mainly) are released into the atmosphere in many ways, including through the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal and petroleum) and by deforestation. As some environments warm (e.g. the Arctic tundra) they also release carbon that may have been stored for thousands of years.






**What is the big deal of COP21?**

COP21 is seen as something of a “last hope”, and a vital step to getting global agreement on emissions reductions. The aim is to keep global warming below 2° C. This agreement to applicable from 2020 on is meant to follow on the Kyoto protocol which came into effect in 2005. While the Kyoto protocol was only ratified by developped countries, the challenge of the COP21 is to bring together the 195 participating states around an agreement. 


COP21 brings together leaders from around the world with the aim of achieving a legally binding and universal agreement on the climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2°C. This will happen through discussion on emissions reductions and other measures required to avert the looming global catastrophe of climate change.
